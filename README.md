# UB-ANC Emulator
## An Emulation Framework for Multi-Agent Drone Networks
UB-ANC Emulator is an emulation environment created to design, implement, and test various applications (missions) involving one or more drones in software, and provide seamless transition to experimentation. It provides flexibility in terms of the underlying flight dynamics and network simulation models. By default, it provides low-fidelity flight dynamics and network simulation, thus high scalability (it can support a large number of emulated agents). Depending on the application, it can connect to a high-fidelity physics engine for more accurate flight dynamics of agents (drones). It can also connect to a high-fidelity network simulation to model the effect of interference, packet losses, and protocols on network throughput, latency, and reliability (e.g., we have integrated [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) into the emulator). Another important aspect of the UB-ANC Emulator is its ability to be extended to different setups and connect to external communication hardware. This capability allows robotics researchers to emulate the mission planning part in software while the network researcher tests new network protocols on real hardware, or allows a network of real drones to connect to emulated drones and coordinate their tasks.

## Build
The current version of UB-ANC Emulator uses [QGroundControl 3.2](http://qgroundcontrol.com) and [ns-3.27](https://www.nsnam.org) as its main libraries. The build process explained here is targeted for Linux (Debian compatible) platforms. In order to use the emulator on other platforms such as Windows, you can use a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 installed. There is also a Docker image provided that can be used. Please read [Docker](#docker) section for more detail. First, these packages need to be installed:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential \
    libgl1-mesa-dev libsdl2-dev python-future \
    libfontconfig1 dbus-x11 geoclue curl git netcat xvfb
```

Then we can use `build_emulator.sh` to build and setup the emulator.

```
cd ~
mkdir ub-anc && cd ub-anc
curl -sSL \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmodares/UB-ANC-Emulator/master/script/build_emulator.sh \
    | bash
```

The build process may take sometime. After the build finished, a new directory **emulator** has been provided which has everything needed to run the emulator.

> You need to logout and login again to run the emulator properly.

## Configuration
UB-ANC Emulator uses **objects** directory to recognizes agents (drones) in the system. Every directory in the **objects** directory represents an emulated agent (drone). The naming format is **mav_xxx**, where xxx shows the ID, in the range **001 - 250**. In each **mav_xxx** directory there are three main files:
* **agent**
  * The mission executable
* **arducopter**
  * The firmware executable emulating the flight controller
* **copter.parm**
  * The default parameters used in firmware

This can be done by running `setup_objects.sh n`, where `n` is the number of agents in the network.

```
cd ~/ub-anc/emulator
./setup_objects.sh 10
```

To setup the **objects** directory, the script uses all three default files from **mav** directory in **emulator**. By default the agent executable is the [follower](https://github.com/jmodares/follower) mission. To build and test different mission, you need to use [UB-ANC Agent](https://github.com/jmodares/UB-ANC-Agent), and put it in the **mav** directory.

## Run
To run the emulator, use `start_emulator.sh`. It first starts all firmwares, waits for emulator to connect to all firmwares, and then starts all corresponding agents so that they can connect to the emulator.

```
cd ~/ub-anc/emulator
./start_emulator.sh
```

Note that you can not start the mission until you receive the following messages from drones, which will appear in the [Vehicle Messages](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/toolbar/toolbar.html) window in QGroundControl:

```
[XXX] Info: EKF2 IMU0 is using GPS
[XXX] Info: EKF2 IMU1 is using GPS
```

All options that are available to [QGroundControl](https://dev.qgroundcontrol.com/en/command_line_options.html) and [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/tweaking.html) are also available in the emulator, and you can set them in the script in *start_emulator* function. You can also utilize the logging capabilities of [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/logging.html). As you can see in the *start_emulator* function, the emulator starts with **AODV** routing protocol when it runs in console mode. You can change or add more options if you need, especially you can change *RxGain, Reception gain (dB)*, or modulation and data rate, and see their effects during the mission.

You can also run the emulator in console mode (without GUI):

```
cd ~/ub-anc/emulator
./start_emulator.sh -c
```

This is useful when the GUI is not available or not needed. To visualize the agents (drones) when emulator runs in console mode, you need to install [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads) and connect to the agents' corresponding ports.

> It should be noted that port **10 * i + 5760** can be used to connect to agent (drone) **i**. 

## Docker
There is a public Docker image with UB-ANC Emulator installed that can be loaded and used. First, you need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation) (or [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) if you are using an older Mac or Windows system that does not meet the requirements of Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows). If you are using Linux, you can then setup Docker's [privilege access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/)). 

After installing Docker, the following commands should be typed into the Terminal (in windows, use Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, or the Docker Terminal) to build the UB-ANC Emulator Docker image locally:

```
docker build -t jmod/ub-anc-emulator:latest \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmodares/UB-ANC-Emulator/master/script/Dockerfile
```

If you don't build the image locally, Docker will download it automatically. On Linux platforms you can run Docker container and connect it to X server on the host so that you can run the emulator in the container with GUI:

```
xauth nlist $DISPLAY \
    | sed -e 's/^..../ffff/' \
    | xauth -f /tmp/.docker.xauth nmerge -
docker run -it \
    --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    --env XAUTHORITY=/tmp/.docker.xauth \
    --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    --volume /tmp/.docker.xauth:/tmp/.docker.xauth \
    --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
    --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd \
    --volume $PWD/docker:/tmp/emulator \
    --publish 5770:5770 \
    --publish 5780:5780 \
    jmod/ub-anc-emulator:latest
```

On other platforms though, you need to find a way to map the X server socket between container and host, like [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) for Windows. A better solution is to run the container without mapping:

```
docker run -it \
    --volume $pwd/docker:/tmp/emulator \
    --publish 5770:5770 \
    --publish 5780:5780 \
    jmod/ub-anc-emulator:latest
```

Then you can start the emulator in console mode, and use [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads) on the host to connect to agent's port to visualize it in the system.

Two things need to be noticed:
* As you can see a new directory **docker** will be created on the host (in the current directory), and it will be mounted to **/tmp/emulator** directory on the container. This can be used to share files between the host and the container.
* In order to connect to a port in container, you need to publish it `--publish` to the host, as you can see in the previous commands we publish two ports so that we can connect to them with QGroundControl (running on the host).

After you login to the container, you can start by:

```
cp -r emulator/ /tmp/
cd /tmp/emulator
```

By copying the **emulator** to the **/tmp/emulator**, you populate the container's **emulator** directory into the **docker** directory on the host so that you have access to the files generated by emulator later.

You can also use **docker** dirctory to put the mission source code and then build the mission using container. Notice that the username and password is **ub-anc**.

> Check all scripts in the **script** directory for more information.
